Studied imbalanced data impact on predictive models. Balance may distort calibrations, and threshold shifting affects sensitivity and specificity.

In this study, an investigation was conducted into the impact of rebalancing imbalanced datasets on predictive model performance. It was observed that attempts to balance such datasets often yielded unexpected consequences, including the distortion of model calibrations and an increase in the risk of improper overtreatment due to overestimation of the minority class. Additionally, shifting probability thresholds for classification exhibited a similar impact on model sensitivity and specificity as imbalance correction methods.
